# Random data using 52-bit mantissa scaled with 2^b.
# Generated in blocks of 10 with b:
# {-50:5:-5} {-4:1:-1} {0,0,0} {1,1,1} {2,2,2} {3,3,3}
# {4,4,4,4} {5,5,5,5} {6,6,6,6} {8:2:28}
# An additional 10 positive test points generated in the range
# [26.3, 27.3] where erfc(x) transitions to sub-normal.
# Reference values from customized Boost C++ 128-bit implementation
# of erfc modifed to remove scaling by exp(-x^2). Values for large x
# generated using the upper_gamma_fraction(...) continued fraction
# See: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Erfc.html Eq.3

# Partition: 26.543258454251 <= z < 100
# z, erfcx(z)
